## Key Features:

✅ Book Catalog: Display a list of books with their cover images, titles, authors, and brief descriptions. ❌ Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large book collections.

✅ Search Functionality: Add a search bar that allows users to search for books by title, author, or keywords. ❌ The search results should update dynamically as the user types.

Book Details: When a user clicks on a book, show a detailed page with more information about the book, including a longer description, average ratings, and reviews (you can use mock data for reviews).

Shopping Cart: Allow users to add books to their shopping cart. Display the number of items in the cart and the total cost. Users should be able to view the cart contents and remove items if needed.
